HOW TO PUSH TO GITHUB

Initialize a git in that folder if not already created
- [ ] git init

Check the status of everything
- [ ] git status
- [ ] Everything should be red (because we haven’t made any commits)

Add folder items
- [ ] git add .
- [ ] Shouldn’t really see any changes

Check the status of everything
- [ ] git status
- [ ] Everything should be green (because its tracking the files)

- [ ] git commit -m “init commit”

Now in GitHub create new repository 
- [ ] Repository name same as file name (can skip everything else just create)
- [ ] Select SSH (should already come pre chosen but still check)
“From create a new repository on the command line”
- [ ] Copy last 2 lines one by one paste in terminal
- [ ] Ex of second to last line (git remote add origin git@github.com:Eric-Barajas/daikichiRoutes.git)
- [ ] Ex of last line (git push -u origin main)

Back in terminal
- [ ] Look for “main —> main” on third line from bottom to top (shows you it worked)

Go back to GitHub refresh the page (should see whatever we wanted to push)
